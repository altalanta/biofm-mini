## Our Pledge

## Our Standards
- Use inclusive language and assume good intent.
- Actively mentor newcomers and document decisions.
- Avoid derailing conversations or sharing sensitive data without consent.

## Enforcement
Report unacceptable behaviour to the maintainers at `opensource@example.com`. Reports will be reviewed promptly and handled confidentially. Maintainers may take any action deemed appropriate, including warnings or removal of contributions.

This Code of Conduct applies across GitHub issues, pull requests, review comments, chat, and any other project spaces.
